      <h1>Simple Content</h1>

      <p>I've used one adjective to describe myself. What is it? Professional. Yeah, like I'm going to spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit? Come on! It's not like envy, or even hungry!</p>
      
      <p>It's so watery. And yet there's a smack of ham to it. George Michael may be suffering from what we in the soft-sciences call Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, or the "OC Disorder." Dad would stage elaborate situations using a one-armed man to teach us lessons. I'd want to get in there and find some answers.</p>
      
      <h1>Another Top Heading</h1>
      <p>These are my awards, Mother. From Army. The seal is for marksmanship, and the gorilla is for sand racing. I run a pretty tight ship around here. With a pool table? It's a gaming ship.</p>
      
      <p>Absolutely. And we're going to be here every day. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. Look at us, crying like a bunch of girls on the last day of camp.</p>
      
      <p>No borders, no limitsâ€¦ go ahead, touch the Cornballer... you know best? I will pack your sweet pink mouth with so much ice cream you'll be the envy of every Jerry and Jane on the block! She wanted to look 48. I nearly airbrushed her into oblivion. Ended up checking "albino" on the form. I am going to my spin class. I thought you had vertigo.</p>
      
      <p>Well, obviously, I'm not a big guy. I'm not a Carl Weathers, par example. Probably out there without a flipper, swimming around in a circle, freaking out his whole family.</p>
      
      <h1>Last Section</h1>
      <p>She calls it a Mayonegg. So Ann, the question is, do you want a man or a boy? I know how I would answer. No, she's in it. She's a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is. I think I might have someone who's going to circumvrent the law.</p>
      
      <p>Perhaps an attic, shall I seek.</p>
      
      <p>George Michael I'm sure Egg is a very nice person. Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In layman's terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. There's unlimited juice? This party is gonna be off the hook.</p>
